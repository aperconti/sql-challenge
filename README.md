The number of employees with repeating names is highly suspect. The only original name is April Fools. 

The job title and compensation raise concern, as well. The top paid employee is not an executive but instead a Technique Leader, which is a made-up job title. Furthermore, the minimum paid employee is an Assistant Engineer. 

The differences in pay, according to employee title, also raises concern. There are minimal increases in salary from Assistant to Senior level in engineering, with several Senior Engineers making a few dollars more than Assistant Engineers. 

These findings have lead me to believe that this dataset is not original.
